- Management-review policy controls are implemented and configurable.
- GL scaffolding and reporting controls are present.

Validation tests
- `Tenant isolation blocks cross-tenant access`
- `Audit events are append-only`
- `Period close requires manager role`

Evidence output
- `audit_trail.csv`

Implemented: `Complete`

Files
- `GovConMoney.Domain/Enums/DomainEnums.cs`
- `GovConMoney.Application/Services/TimesheetService.cs`
- `GovConMoney.Application/Services/BillingService.cs`

How it works
- Labor and expense entries carry `CostType` and are processed distinctly.

Validation tests
- `Indirect rates compute apply rerate and post to GL`
- `Billing generation excludes unallowable costs`

Evidence output
- `labor_distribution.csv`
- `project_summary.csv`

How it works
- Indirect rates are computed as `pool_total / base_total`.
- Allocation base method is configurable (`PoolBaseCostTypeLaborDollars`, `DirectLaborDollars`, `DirectLaborHours`, `TotalLaborHours`).
- Apply and rerate use the selected base method consistently.
- Final rates are manager-gated before burden application.

Validation tests
- `Indirect rates compute apply rerate and post to GL`
- `Indirect base method direct labor hours drives rate and burden`
- `Final indirect rates require manager approval before apply`

Evidence output

- Manager review events are captured for evidence packages.

Validation tests
- `Period close requires manager role`
- `Final indirect rates require manager approval before apply`
- `Billing threshold routes approval to manager for high-value runs`

Evidence output
- `manager_review_events.csv`
- `audit_trail.csv`

Human policy engagement
- Internal-audit cadence, sampling plans, CAPA tracking, and independent review charters are procedural and must be run by the organization.

- Close is manager-gated.

Validation tests
- `Monthly close compliance flags overdue open periods`
- `Period close requires manager role`

Evidence output
- `audit_trail.csv`
- `manager_review_events.csv`

Human policy engagement
- Meeting the "at least monthly" standard also depends on operational discipline to execute close/posting on schedule.

Implemented: `Absent`

Files
- `N/A`

How it works
- No explicit preproduction/production classification model exists today.

Validation tests
- `N/A`

Evidence output
- `N/A`

Minimal implementation plan
- Add cost phase dimension (`Preproduction`, `Production`) on timesheet/expense/burden and reporting.
- Add validation/policy rules by contract/CLIN where required.
- Add reconciliation/report artifacts by phase.

Human policy engagement
- Determining when a program transitions from preproduction to production is a contract/program governance decision and requires documented policy and approval records.
